/**
Resume: Use of Streams in Java

Streams in Java provide a powerful and efficient way to process collections of data. 
They allow for concise and expressive code, enabling developers to perform complex operations 
on data with ease. In this resume, we will explore the different types of streams and their usage 
with examples.

1. IntStream:
   - IntStream is used to process streams of primitive integers.
   - Example: Summing all the even numbers from 1 to 10 using IntStream.
     ```java
     int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
     int sum = Arrays.stream(numbers)
                           .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)
                           .sum();
     ```
     Result: `sum = 30`
